### VM Setup
Use the mininet-vm image from lab 3 and mount the load_balancer directory as a volume. The docker/devcontainer doesn't work for CPULimitedHosts (which we need for performance) testing but will be left (for now) as a reference for any dependencies we miss in the VM.

### Developing in the VM
Highly recommend using VSCode remote development using ssh into the VM.
